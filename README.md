# Project React Native

Mobile App built in React Native and styled with StyleSheet. The app consists of a bunch od React Native components, has a Drawer Navigation to move between screens where you can either shake your phone and get a random quote, or ask a question to a Magic Eight Ball.

## The problem

I started the project by installing all dependencies, and to get the app to show in Expo. Then I started testing different React Native components, such as Drawer Navigation, TextInput and TouchableOpacity. I planned to do two different screens to try different components and features, such as sensors and vibration. I started adding logic to the first page where data is fetched from an API, so that a new quote is dsplayed everytime the phone is being shaked. In the second screen, I created a basig Magic Eight Ball game where the user can ask a question and get a randomized answer.
To make the app richer, I added some logic to reset the states when navigating between screens, validation and alert message to the textinput, and Lottie loaders so that the waiting time is fine for the user. After creating all logic and components, I started styling with StyleSheet, which I found more convenient than Styled Components.

If I had more time I would love to try some more sensors and to style the Navigator.
